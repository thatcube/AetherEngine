/// decoder stamps the cue with an open-ended placeholder window, and the SUCCESSOR composition's
/// trim closes it (`pgsTrimAt`). In steady state insert and trim land within a frame of each
/// other and nothing untoward shows. When the side reader catches up after starvation (the #96
/// class), the backlog arrives with multi-second decode gaps and every historical cue's open
/// window covers the playhead the moment it inserts, so ~seconds of stale subtitles flash
/// through the overlay one by one.
///
/// The gate holds a PGS event whose cues start more than `staleEpsilonSeconds` behind the
/// playhead (a catch-up signature; a live cue at a seek landing anchors at most ~2 s back and
/// passes straight through). The next PGS event or clear event resolves the hold: trimmed to the
/// successor's start, the cue publishes only if its true window covers the playhead (it is the
/// genuinely active subtitle), otherwise it is dropped silently. Trade-off, accepted: the LAST
/// backlog cue has no successor yet and stays held until the next composition arrives; missing
/// one line briefly beats replaying 80 s of history through the live overlay.
