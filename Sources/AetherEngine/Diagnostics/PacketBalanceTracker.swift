/// Process-wide counters for `av_packet_alloc` / `av_packet_free` calls
/// we initiate from Swift. Reads as `pktAlive = allocs - frees` in the
/// engine memory probe.
///
/// Steady-state for a healthy pump is a low single digit:
///   - 1 for the source packet currently inside the pump's defer block
///   - 1 each for `pendingVideoPkt` / `pendingAudioPkt` look-behind
///   - 0..N for FLAC packets the bridge has emitted but the pump hasn't
///     yet handed to the muxer + freed
///
/// Linearly rising `pktAlive` across probe samples means we're leaking
/// packets — every leaked AVPacket carries a refcounted data buffer
/// that's typically 3-50 KB, so even a single leaked packet per video
/// frame ≈ ~75 KB/s = 4.5 MB/min, in the right ballpark for the
/// observed long-form memory leak.
///
/// All call-sites in the producer / bridge / demuxer / subtitle decoder
/// go through `trackedPacketAlloc()` + `trackedPacketFree(_:)` wrappers
/// so the counter is comprehensive across paths we control.
/// Libavformat-internal allocations (mp4 muxer's interleave queue,
/// matroska parser's side data, etc.) are not counted here — those
/// flow through `av_packet_ref` / `av_packet_unref` against the same
/// buffer ref, not separate `av_packet_alloc` calls.
